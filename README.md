#  Daily Calander

## Description

This mock up page is a Daily Calander. Users are able to create inputs into a daily scheduled at given times to keep track of daily tasks. Legend will explain tasks that are currently due at the time. User can also clear all taks by clicking on the clear button. To save a new task, user can type into box next to given time and then click on "save icon" next to box (also seen as a floppy disk). If page is refreahed the saved tasks should still be on the page.

## Future Ideas
1. Drop box so user can type in one location and select time to input.
2. Calendar for a week instead of a day.
3. More efficienct JavaScript instead of a bunch of if-else statments.
